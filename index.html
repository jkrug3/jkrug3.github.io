    <h1>Jackson Krug</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m James, a 16-year-old junior at Washington-Liberty High School. I love playing football and have been doing it for a few years. I’m always practicing to get better. Football is really important to me, whether I’m playing with my team or getting ready for a game. I like the fun and teamwork that comes with it. When I’m not on the field, I hang out with friends, follow football news, and eat pizza—my favorite food!</p>

    <p>I enjoy the fun and teamwork that come with it. I also like to think outside the box and solve problems, whether on the field or in everyday life. When I’m not playing football, I hang out with my dog, spend time with friends,<p>
